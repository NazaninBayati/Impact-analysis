Impact analysis
In this project we have two basic goals:
   -	Analyzing the source code to extract all dependencies
   
   -	Apply it on different granularities i.e. file-level, class-level, function-level
   
Analyzing the source code

We are looking for a complete group of dependencies. Therefore, we first extract the structural dependencies then we check the logical dependencies.

   -	In structural dependency: 
   -	In logical dependency:
   
Supporting different granularities: 

The project could be applied for various code granularities including:

   -	File level
   -	Class level
   -	Function level
   
Mostly projects which are written in C/C++ are our target.
